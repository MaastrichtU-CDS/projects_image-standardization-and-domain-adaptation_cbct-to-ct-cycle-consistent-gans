# Name of The Paper

[Paper](UPDATE)

We used [ganslate](https://github.com/ganslate-team) framework for these experiments.

## Structure

This repository contains the experiment configuration files and PyTorch dataset loading and preprocessing for our paper "Name of The Paper".

It is organized into two folders:

- `LungProton` - experiments and dataset classes for **lung** CBCT-to-CT translation for adaptive **proton** radiotherapy

- `CervixPhoton` - experiments and dataset classes for **cervix** CBCT-to-CT translation for adaptive **photon** radiotherapy

## Running

To run the experiments (if you have access to the data):
```
pip install ganslate

git clone git@github.com:ganslate-team/placeholder-name.git # UPDATE
cd placeholder-name # UPDATE

# change the config file accordingly
ganslate train config="./LungProton/experiments/1_2D_cyclegan_vnet.yaml" 
```
